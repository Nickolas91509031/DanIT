            <p class="mixed-breeds-wrapper__description">No matter what mix of breeds, mutts are awesome. Mixed-breeds are believed to have less genetically inherited health problems than purebreds, according to veterinarian Dr. Sarah Ward Fatula.</p>
            <p class="mixed-breeds-wrapper__description">Plus, if you adopt your mixed-breed from the shelter, not only will they already be spayed/neutered, microchipped, and up to date with vaccines, but you'll also be helping with the pet overpopulation problem.</p>

            <p class="mixed-breeds-wrapper__description">They are devoted and obedient and have even temperaments that make them good with both children and other animals.
                Bred to be eager to please and playful companions, Labs are smart and commonly chosen as guide dogs and service dogs for blind or autistic individuals.</p>
